/** This trait provides state and process management functionality for verification servers.
  *
  * The server runs on Akka's actor system. This means that the entire server's state
  * and process management are run by actors. The 3 actors in charge are:
  *
  *   1) Job Actor
  *   2) Queue Actor
  *   3) Terminator Actor
  *
  *  The first two actors manage individual verification processes. I.e., on
  *  initializeVerificationProcess() and instance of each actor is created. The JobActor launches
  *  the actual VerificationTask, while the QueueActor acts as a middleman for communication
  *  between a VerificationTask's backend and the server. The Terminator Actor is in charge of
  *  terminating both individual processes and the server.
